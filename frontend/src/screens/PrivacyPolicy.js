            <h3>Third Party Vendors</h3>
            <p><strong>We may share your account information with third parties in some circumstances, including:</strong>&nbsp;(1) with your consent; (2) to a service provider or partner who meets our data protection standards; (3) for survey or research purposes, after aggregation, anonymization, or pseudonymization; (4) when we have a good faith belief it is required by law, such as pursuant to a subpoena or other legal process; (5) when we have a good faith belief that doing so will help prevent imminent harm to someone.</p>
            <p><strong>Data Storage</strong><br />HowTo Community uses third-party vendors and hosting partners for hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology we need to run HowTo Community. By using HowTo Community Services, you authorize HowTo Community to transfer, store, and use your information in the United States and any other country where we operate. All service providers and third-party vendors are required to meet our data protection standards.</p>
            <p><strong>Site monitoring</strong><br />HowTo Community uses a variety of third-party services to diagnose errors and improve the performance of our site. We aim to minimize the amount of personal information shared, but the information may include your IP address or other identifying information. All service providers and third-party vendors are required to meet our data protection standards.</p>
            <p><strong>Payment processing</strong><br />HowTo Community does not process payments directly &mdash; we rely on third-party services such as Stripe, Shopify, and Paypal to receive payments and store any payment information.</p>
            <p><strong>Third-Party Embeds</strong><br />Some of the content that you see displayed on HowTo Community is not hosted by HowTo Community. These &ldquo;embeds&rdquo; are hosted by a third-party and embedded in HowTo Community. For example: YouTube videos, Codepens, Twitter tweets, or GitHub code that appear within a HowTo Community post. These files send data to the hosted site just as if you were visiting that site directly (for example, when you load a HowTo Community post page with a YouTube video embedded in it, YouTube receives data about your activity). HowTo Community does not control what data third parties collect in cases like this, or what they will do with it. Third-party embeds on HowTo Community are not covered by this privacy policy; they are covered by the privacy policy of the third-party service. Be mindful when interacting with these services.</p>
            <p><strong>Facebook (visitor action pixel)</strong><br />We use the &ldquo;visitor action pixels&rdquo; from Facebook Inc on our website.<br /><br />This allows user behavior to be tracked after they have been redirected to our website by clicking on a Facebook ad. This enables us to measure the effectiveness of Facebook ads. The data collected in this way is anonymous to us, i.e. we do not see the personal data of individual users. However, this data is stored and processed by Facebook, which is why we are informing you, based on our knowledge of the situation.
